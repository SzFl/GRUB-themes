# GRUB2 gfxmenu default theme by SzFl

## Version history:

1.00: first release 

## Introduction:
	
This theme for GRUB2 was made for devices with screen resolution 1920x1080 and it might not work for smaller ones. 

Theme format seems to be not stable (for 08.2024): 
- structures like hbox and vbox are hard to manage. 
- canvas causes many errors for elements it contains with decorators and parameters like 'selected_item_pixmap_style' or 'menu_pixmap_style'.
- Only .png files for pictures seems to work.

I hope this theme will be robust in a long time.

## Usage:	

All resources(files, fonts etc.) required by this theme are supplied with it.

## Remarks: 

Theme was heavily inspired by two other themes:
- starfield - made by Daniel Tschudi
- manjaro default theme - I do not know author

All fonts, all png decorators and some parameters of components was inspired by themes above.
